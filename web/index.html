<h1>xxdiff Homepage Moved</h1>

<p>
The official homepage for xxdiff is
now <a href="http://furius.ca/xxdiff">http://furius.ca/xxdiff</a>.
You should be redirected in a few seconds.
</p>

<p>
I--the author, Martin Blais--was getting really annoyed with maintaining two web
pages up-to-date at the same time and therefore I have decided to rationalize
all my projects on my own server, where everything gets updated automagically.
Don't worry this project is still being maintained actively.
</p>

<p>
In case my server is down (not supposed to be), to view a copy of the possibly
outdated pages at SourceForge, you can always
click <a href="local/index.html">HERE</a>.
