functionality and look-and-feel as xdiff, is provided as open source and
adds many many useful new features. It runs on many popular unices, including
IRIX, Linux, Solaris, HP/UX, DEC Tru64.

</ul>
xxdiff is tested daily in a merge reviewing/policing context by about 50
engineers at my workplace (<a href="http://www.discreet.com">discreet</a>),
and since this task is a significant part of their development process,
many of the features are a direct result of suggestions from these people.
<p>You will find other <a href="http://dmoz.org/Computers/Software/File_Management/File_Comparison/">file
comparison programs at dmoz</a>. If you find a feature that is not available
in xxdiff that you feel should be there, please let me know and I'll add
it to the wishlist. The following major features are being actively worked
on:
<ul>
<li>
Configuration management integration (RCS, CVS, ClearCase)</li>

<li>
Internationalization</li>
</ul>
Keep your eye on freshmeat for updates.
