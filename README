xxdiff: Graphical File And Directories Comparator And Merge Tool
================================================================

.. contents:: Table of Contents

Description
===========

This is the official home of **xxdiff**, a graphical file and
directories comparator and merge tool.

**xxdiff** is provided under the GNU GPL open source license. It has
reached stable state, and is known to run on many popular unices,
including IRIX, Linux, Solaris, HP/UX, DEC Tru64.  It has been
deployed inside many large organizations and is being actively
maintained by its author (Martin Blais).


Features
--------

- Comparing **two** files, **three** files, or two **directories**
  (shallow and recursive);

- **Horizontal diffs** highlighting;

- Files can be **merged** interactively and resulting output
  visualized and saved;

- Has features to assist in performing **merge reviews/policing**;

- Can **unmerge CVS conflicts** in automatically merged file and
  display them as two files, to help resolve conflicts;

- Uses **external diff program** to compute differences: works with
  GNU diff, SGI diff and ClearCase's cleardiff, and any other diff
  whose output is similar to those;

- Fully customizable with a resource file;

- Look-and-feel similar to Rudy Wortel's/SGI xdiff, it is desktop
  agnostic (i.e. will work equally well with KDE or Gnome);

- Features and output that ease integration with scripts.

**xxdiff** was (and probably still is) tested daily in a merge
reviewing/policing context by more than 50 engineers at `discreet
<http://www.discreet.com>`_, and since this task is a
significant part of their development process, many of the features
are a direct result of suggestions from these people while the author
was working there.

New releases and updates are announced on freshmeat. You can register
for notification at either freshmeat or sourceforge.  xxdiff is
implemented in C++ and its runtime dependencies is only the **Qt UI
toolkit** from TrollTech.

Unicode and Inline Editing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**xxdiff** does not support comparing files encoded with Unicode.
Also, it does not support inline editing of the diffed files.  If you
need these features, you could try emacs or Meld (although both of
these lack some of the most interesting features of xxdiff).

  though.


Tools
-----

**xxdiff** comes with a bunch of wrapper Python scripts that invoke xxdiff in
creative ways.  The author has been using these for a long time now and decided
for version 3.0 to clean them up and make them a little more generic so everyone
can use them.

- `xxdiff-conf-replace <doc/xxdiff-cond-replace.html>`_: conditional to a user's
  acceptance (or merge decision), replace an original file by a new file
  (typically the result of some external process). This is useful in shell
  loops, a general purpose interactive conditional copy operation;

- `xxdiff-find-grep-sed <doc/xxdiff-find-grep-sed.html>`_: walk a directory
  hierarchy, and perform a conditional sed replacement on a given pattern,
  accepting, rejecting or merging each change graphically;

- `xxdiff-encrypted <doc/xxdiff-encrypted.html>`_: compare contents of encrypted
  files and merged into encrypted file.  This script takes care of decrypting
  the input files and encrypting the merged output file with `gpg
  <http://www.gnupg.org>`_.

- `xxdiff-match <doc/xxdiff-match.html>`_: run xxdiff on a arbitrary set of
  files, matching pairs or triples of files by basename. This effectively allows
  you to do something like this::

     xxdiff-match srcold/*.c srcnew/*.c

- `xxdiff-patch <doc/xxdiff-patch-UNFINISHED.html>`_ (UNFINISHED): preview and
  accept/reject a patch to a set of files.  **This script is unfinished because
  we have not been dealing with file additions and deletions, feel free to chip
  in**;

- `xxdiff-cvs-diff <doc/xxdiff-cvs-diff.html>`_: preview CVS changes and if
  desired accept/reject changes to commit individually;

.. - `xxdiff-subversion <doc/xxdiff-subversion.html>`_: wrapper for xxdiff
..   that you can use to set the diff-cmd and diff3-cmd user configuration
..   values for `subversion <http://subversion.tigris.org>`_.


Working versions and help files for `scripts that support configuration
management systems <tools>`_ can be found in the distribution under the tools/
directory (CVS, ClearCase, etc.).

Reporting Bugs
==============

* `Reporting Bugs <http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=2198>`_
  *(bugs and feature requests)*

**PLEASE!** report bugs using the bug tracker instead of email. It is extremely
simple, quick and easy to use, you don't even have to have a SourceForge
account, and it allows me to track issues and desired features, as well as keep
a history and dates.  Please do not send the author email about bugs.  Log them,
you don't even need a SourceForge account. Thank you.
