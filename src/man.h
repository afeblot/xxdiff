"       xxdiff - a graphical file comparator and merge tool\n"
"\n"
"SYNOPSIS\n"
"       xxdiff [OPTIONS] <path> <path> [<path>]\n"
"\n"
"OVERVIEW\n"
"       xxdiff is a graphical browser for viewing the differences\n"
"       between two files and can be used to produce a merged ver­\n"
"       sion.  The text of the two or three files are presented\n"
"       side by side with their differences highlighted for easy\n"
"       identification.\n"
"\n"
"       The paths supplied on the command line identify the files\n"
"       to be compared.	The paths may be one of three things:  a\n"
"       regular file, a directory or a '-', in which case the\n"
"       input for that path will be read from standard input.  If\n"
"       the paths are all directories, a directory diff will be\n"
"       done (unsupported at this moment).  If at least one path\n"
"       is a file or a '-', a file diff will be performed.  If\n"
"       there are directory names along with file names, the base­\n"
"       name of the file name will be appended to the directory\n"
"       names to find the other files to compare with.  If there\n"
"       are multiple file names specified and some directories\n"
"       names as well, xxdiff bails out, since it doesn't know\n"
"       which basename to use for the missing one.\n"
"\n"

"DESCRIPTION\n"
"       The xxdiff window is divided into 3 main areas. These are,\n"
"       the menu bar at the top of the window, an overview area on\n"
"       the right side of the window and a text area occupying the\n"
"       remainder. The text area is further divided into two text\n"
"       windows, one for each file, a vertical slider between them\n"
"       and a horizontal slider underneath them.\n"
"\n"
"       The text in each of the text panes is divided into blocks\n"
"       of lines which are color-coded with one of five different\n"
"       colors.	This indicates that the block either differs\n"
"       between the two files, is identical between the two files,\n"
"       has been inserted in one file or the other, is for display\n"
"       purposes (to match an inserted block in the other file),\n"
"       or has been selected by the user (for writing to a merged\n"
"       file).\n"
"\n"
"       These colors can be modified by the user via the\n"
"       resources or user interface.  Resources can be\n"
"       specified thru pairs of values in the format: <resource\n"
"       name>: <value> in a ~/.xxdiffrc file (the environment\n"
"       variable XXDIFFRC can override this location).\n"
"\n"
"       On the right-hand side of the display is an overview area;\n"
"       this shows the files in their entirety.\n"
"\n"
"DIAGNOSTICS\n"
"       Returns the exit status generated by the diff command.\n"
"       This is usually 0 for no differences, 1 for some differ­\n"
"       ences and 2 for errors.\n"
