CHANGES for xxdiff
------------------------------

------------------------------

Version 1.8:

   * Release.
     Recursive directory diffs and fix for broken 3-way diffs in 1.7.

Version 1.7.6:

   * Fixed 3-way diffs that were broken between 1.6.9 and 1.6.12.
     (Will have to release again because of that.)
   * Fixed bugs in new space-tidying function.
   * Remove undef calls, so that XX_TRACE() works everywhere, replaced by
     uniform XX_LOCAL_TRACE() trick.
   * Factored options dialog into three tabs, disabled 2-way options in 3-way 
     mode.
   * Removed old diff options dialog.
   * Creating errors in editing options should display errors in dialog, 
     cleaned up cerr output, now goes into dialog.

Version 1.7.5:

   * Bug fixes.
   * More work on options dialog.
   * Fixed recursive diff and build solely from output combination.
   * Major review of resource names.
   * United colors.
   * Resource improvements, lots of important changes, user-visible 
     consequences (resource names have changed).
   * Added resources for GNU diff options (-r) (-i) etc

Version 1.7.4:

   * Some unfinished work on changing command lines.

Version 1.7.3:

   * Sped up resources compilation with a simple const.
   * Completed UI menus changes.
   * Fixed bug in dir diffs parsing.
   * Added designer dialog for diff options, unfinished implementing.
   * Added direcotry color in color legend.
   * Removed forced italic font, we can just use the SGI style now.

Version 1.7.2:

   * Add recursive option to diff options menu.
   * Hide files goes in dir diff options menu.
   * Separate options that influence the diff command line and those that
     are only about display. ("diff options" menu vs. "display" menu)
   * Move "redo diff" and "diff args" into new "options" menu.
   * Move "hide CR" menu in new "display" menu.

Version 1.7.1:

   * In overview, coverage line is covering region properly now (it used to
     cover to the center of lines).
   * Parsing of directory diffs is now done using solely the diff output, and
     not reading the directories themselves anymore.
   * Fixes for recursive directory diffs. Recursive now works!!
   * Added resources for supporting recursive and non-recursive dir diff.

------------------------------

Version 1.7:

   * Release.
     Directory diffs introduction warrants major number release but I'll
     release 2.0 when recursive directory diffs work. For work we'll let
     some people bang on it before 2.0.

Version 1.6.17:

   * Fixed compilation with g++ under Linux.

Version 1.6.16:

   * Added forgotten "common subdirectories" parsing to dir diffs parser.
   * Fixed hunks in dir diffs.
   * Fixed color documentation bug.
   * Added "directories" line type and resources (colors).
   * Fixed bug: running xxdiff with two empty files crashed it.
   * In directory diffs, a lot of UI has been disabled (e.g. selection).
   * Removed builderDirs2Sep from compilation.
   * Changed the toolbar buttons for directory diffs.
   * Add a toolbar button in dir diffs mode to diff files at cursor
   * Added an option to hide changed files in directory diffs.

Version 1.6.15:

   * Finished first implementation of directory diffs using dir diff parser.

Version 1.6.14:

   * Added support for hiding carriage returns in diffs.

Version 1.6.13:

   * Finished directory diffs parser implementation.

Version 1.6.12:

   * Removed instantiation of std::vector<string> for size.
   * More of implementing the directory diffs builder.

Version 1.6.11:

   * Factored some generic functionailty in XxUtil.
   * Started parser directory diffs builder.

Version 1.6.10:

   * Factored some of the builders simple code into a base class.
   * Started parser directory diffs builder using output of diff -q -s.
   * Changed default configure options to compile rcfile resources by default.

Version 1.6.9:

   * Compiled with qt-2.2.
   * Changed style to use new available SGI style in qt-2.2.
     It now has exactly the SGI looks!
   * Incorporated changes by Bob Bell <bobbell@zk3.dec.com> for Tru64 port.

Version 1.6.8:

   * Cleanup of preliminary parser for directory diffs.
   * Noticed that directory diffs are dead slow, tried to optimize using
     fork()/execve().  Had to provide envp from main().
   * Implemented faulty mouse-drag on merged view.
   * Added diffutils-2.7 source code to package in preparation to link with it
     directly. I think that this will make directory diffs faster.

Version 1.6.7:

   * diff3: When selecting a region whose text is the same as another,
     e.g. DELETE_1 selecting 2 or 3, show both of these as selected (even though
     the selection is allowed to vary between 2 or 3, we don't care).
   * Renamed XxFile to XxBuffer in preparation for dir.diffs.
   * Fixed bug with tooltip. Tooltip now works ok with truncation and resize.
   * Implemented mouse-drag like in emacs on Ctrl+Button3.
   * Fixed bug with copy label.
   * Implemented preliminary directory diffs parsing.

Version 1.6.6:

   * Dist target was broken, put pixmaps back in and getopt.h

Version 1.6.5:

   * Fixed label resizing restriction.
   * Implemented truncation [...] of pathname in filename label.a

Version 1.6.4:

   * Misc. UI changes.
   * Removed forgotten tracing from diff3 builder.
   * Ordered CHANGES file in reversed (makes more sense).

Version 1.6.3:

   * Fixed exit-on-same feature that was broken in 1.6.2 (hubert)
   * Re-introduced support for xdiff's -N feature.

Version 1.6.2:

   * Modified to use GNU getopt_long().
   * Removed -N option and implemented --titleX options instead.
   * Implemented resource specification on cmdline (belley and J.Slade)
   * New menu: windows.
   * Implemented the toolbar and added lame pixmaps.
   * Fixed "socket already in use" bug.

Version 1.6.1:

   * Fixed man page version and bug.
   * Filename labels now show the full filenames as a tooltip if it doesn't fit
     in the label.

------------------------------

Version 1.6:

   * Release. Has been tested by many eng. at DL, quite stable.

Version 1.5.9:

   * Converted signal() to sigaction() for portability (caught by fjaubert).
   * Fiddled makefiles to work under Solaris2.8.

Version 1.5.8:

   * Fixed bug in 3-way diff when diff at the very first line (thanks to 
     Damjan Lango for reporting it).

Version 1.5.7:

   * Fixed Makefile problem with IRIX.
   * Fixed doc distribution makefile problem.
   * Fixed save as bug in 3-way (thanks to hubert for reporting it).

Version 1.5.6:

   * Added documentation which had mysteriously disappeared.

Version 1.5.5:

   * (don't remember what)

Version 1.5.4:

   * Added feature: ask user to save if the selections wouldn't save anything
     different (ask because it could be the case that the file has changed
     from some other program).
   * Fixed majorly important issue: pressing Escape on a dialog did NOT cancel
     before (I can't believe I survived thru this since I always dismiss them
     like that).  Well, now it works as expected.

Version 1.5.3:

   * Fixed cursor centering bug (jaubert).

Version 1.5.2:

   * Wrote SGML documentation!

Version 1.5.1:

   * File renaming in preview of directory diff implementation.
   * Noticed that ``ignore whitespace'' will not work with cleartool diff'',
     fixed that with special case.
   * Wrote tools/diffToClearCase wrapper script.
   * Merged 1.4.6 -> 1.4.7 changes and this.

------------------------------

Version 1.5:

   * Release (lots of bug fixes).

Version 1.4.7:

   * Added horizontal-diffs-ignore-whitespace, which ignores whitespace
     differences when doing diffs horizontally (a separate process than
     the usual line-per-line diffs).  This feature is a little bit tricky:
     you cannot just skip the whitespace, to begin skipping, all the sides 
     have to start with some whitespace.
   * Fixed bug with horizontal diff: rendering tabs wasn't done correctly.
   * Added resource to disable display of cursor (for mcguffm, jfr?).
   * Fixed geometry parsing bug (ptrembla), result is still not perfect, need to
     communicate with winmgr to do it properly.  Qt doesn't offer support there?
   * Fixed makefile linker for libstdc++ rt dependency.
   * Fixed tabs rendering bug.

Version 1.4.6:

   * Fixed nasty bug in diff3 parser (due to funky clearcase reporting).
     Caught by belley, thank you!

Version 1.4.5:

   * Split/swap/merge renamed split/swap/join to avoid confusion with 
     upcomin merge feature.
   * Added merge feature.

Version 1.4.4:

   * Fixed bug on IRIX: \n doesn't show in --help output.
   * Fixed ``return value of 1'' mistake introduced in 1.4.3.
   * Better handling of errors.
   * Added edit left/middle/right feature, accel resources + edit command
     resource.  Works with a signal handler waking up the event queue thru a
     socket.
   * Now warns about ignore resource in rcfile.

Version 1.4.3:

   * rpm_build fix.
   * urgent bugs: problem xxdiffrc (belley).  Specification of command
     resource is now more robust.  Merged command and command-args resources
     (simpler and nicer).
   * changed resource: ignoreErrors is now false by default.

Version 1.4.2:

   * Geometry now includes position, Xt-style (i.e. WxH+L+T), for belley
     (this allows you to specify a full-screen xxdiff).  Caveat: there is
     some flickering on startup, because of Qt limitations: a resize first
     occurs, and then a move.
   * Smaller font for filename labels.

Version 1.4.1:

   * Bug fix: find next unselected and prev unselected were broken.
   * Bug fix: select global unselected wasn't working for first line.
   * Added warn-about-unsaved option/resource for gijsbert.

------------------------------

Version 1.4:

   * Release (stable three-way diffs support).

Version 1.3.13:

   * CHANGES update.
   * Added --list-resources option to list the supported resources and docs.
   * Adding samples.xxdiffrc to bin release becomes unnecessary.
   * Finished gen.init.file feature.  Not sure if I like it too much.
   * Fixing split/swap/join for 3-way structures.
   * Split/swap/join now gets rid of empty lines.

Version 1.3.12:

   * More work on gen.init.file.

Version 1.3.11:

   * Static documentation and correct checking.
   * Expanded cursor 1 pixel up and down for jfr.

Version 1.3.10:

   * Added resource documentation generating capabilities.

Version 1.3.9:

   * Added default bindings Ctrl+R -> Redo Diff for giasson.
   * Fixed buffer allocation bug for string rendering which broke on long lines.
   * Bug fix: horizontal scrollbar is not correct because of varying widths of 
     text widgets due to linenumbers.  adjustScrollbars() cannot deal with it
     correctly since it gets called to adjust on the first widget's resize and
     the other ones haven't been resized yet (at that point).  We need to make
     the line numbers widget all the same size, but for that the lineNumbers
     format string has to be the same for all.
     (fixed).
   * Fixed bottom filling region drawing minor bug.

Version 1.3.8:

   * New ideas in CHANGES.
   * Fixed bug with empty files (for belley).

Version 1.3.7:

   * Fixed Linux compilation.
   * Added "middle" commands.
   * Fixed bug with file open and horizontal diffs.

Version 1.3.6:

   * Fixed IRIX compilation, lexer bug to parse "/".
   * Two scrollbars for 3-way diff.
   * Fixed "next difference" bug.

Version 1.3.5:

   * Three-way diffs now work!

Version 1.3.4:

   * Lots of work towards 3-way, almost there.

Version 1.3.3:

   * More unfinished work on 3-way diffs.

Version 1.3.2:

   * Figured out 3-way diff minimum set.

Version 1.3.1:

   * New ideas in CHANGES file.
   * Started working on diff3 support.
   * (this unstable version will not compile)

------------------------------

Version 1.3:

   * Release.

Version 1.2.15:

   * Fixed 1.2.14-introduced bug with redo diff on empty xxdiff.
   * Made sure foreground color works: fixed bug, it wasn't working.
   * Simplified getting files to other objects.

Version 1.2.14:

   * Updated README.
   * Stripped down man page.
   * Documentation web page: explain use patterns: merging, leaving regions
     unselected for further editing, short-lived diff (an assumption), 
     emacs bindings.
   * Bug fix: crashes when specifying only one file!
   * Finished saving unselected anyway with tagging.
   * Fixed global selection bug.
   * Added all new colors to color legend, improved code a bit.
   * Made the resources object a singleton everywhere in the code.
   * Bug fix: isAsciiText doesn't deal with C-l's (which occurs often in text), 
     make it work as ascii.  Now we're only checking the very first line of
     text.
   * Added diff option toggles and resources and qualities.
   * Bug fix: redo diff twice doesn't reappear (bug under IRIX only)

Version 1.2.13:

   * Fixed Linux compilation.
   * Misc. changes.
   * Wrote web documentation.

Version 1.2.12:

   * Finished merged view (pretty much).  Added cursor drawing, scroll
     tracking and proper resizing.

Version 1.2.11:

   * Comments.

Version 1.2.10:

   * Added a color for unmerged hunk text in merged view.

Version 1.2.9:

   * Made line numbers same width for single hor.scrollbar.
   * Even more fiddling with the merged widget, almost done
     (still have to fix the vscroll)

Version 1.2.8:

   * More fiddling with the merged widget.

Version 1.2.7:

   * Added menu accelerators.
   * Fixed toggle button bug.
   * Added "select X and go to next unselected, wrap around if at the end of
     the file and save if no more unselected" (more simply called "select X and 
     next").  This feature for rapid merging (request by Peter Maly and
     jdilelle).
   * Started sketching out merged view.

Version 1.2.6:

   * Line numbers in their own widget.
   * Bug fix: tabs weren't shifted correctly when showing line numbers
     (-> implement widget)
   * Added a resource for preferred default geometry (for George Zamba)
   * Cleaned up boolean resource access.
   * Added a resource and UI for toggling markers (but no functionality)
   * Bug fix: tabs and horizontal diffs weren't rendered synchronously.
  
Version 1.2.5:

   * Fixed bug in reading accelerators, made nicer.
   * Added some more inline help.
   * If a file is non-existent, now writes which file on stderr (for gijsbert).

Version 1.2.4:

   * Added comments to CHANGES.
   * Wrote proper accelerator reading routine, home/end and func keys now work
     (fixes bug: Shift+F1 help doesn't work on on context menu).
   * Clicking on the filename label puts the filename in the clipboard (this is
     a cool feature for making merge review comments with long ClearCase 
     filenames).

Version 1.2.3:

   * Added reported bug to this file, reorganized this file.

Version 1.2.2:

   * Bug fix: when file is not writable, (e.g. clearcase not checked out) error
     was not reported (reported by gdh).
   * Bug fix: redo diff was broken.  Change one of the files, then redo diff, 
     it crapped out (reported by belley).
   * Moved dialogs in their own compilation unit.
   * Provided simple command to perform redo diff without asking for options 
     (requested by belley)
   * Started sketching out on-context help.

Version 1.2.1:

   * Fixed bug with lots of tabs in long lines.

------------------------------

Version 1.2:

   * Release.

Version 1.1.7:

   * comments added to CHANGES file.

Version 1.1.6:

   * important bug fixed: core dumps on options with whitespace in them.
   * added exitOnSame option thru resource.

Version 1.1.5:

   * Fixed minimum size limitation on filenames.  ClearCase pnames tended to 
     present a limitation on the horizontal size.

Version 1.1.4:

   * Fixed IRIX compilation.

Version 1.1.3:

   * Finished rc file support.
   * Fixed horrible horizontal scrolling bug introduced in 1.1.
   * Added accelerators for horizontal scrollbar.
   * Fixed bug drawing horizontal cursor with hor.scroll bar to the right.
   * Added simple dialog for setting tabs at arbitrary values.
   * Moved compile options into configure script interfaces:
      - optimized vs. debug
      - dynamic vs. static linking for STLport and Qt
   * Better autoconf/automake support.

Version 1.1.2:

   * Unfinished rc file support (~/.xxdiffrc or XXDIFFRC env var).
   * Fixed bug with opening with no files.

Version 1.1.1:

   * Fixed bug: initially setting horizontal diff thru resource wasn't working.
   * Added lighter colors for selected and deleted (looks much nicer in 
     horizontal diffs more).
   * Added "paste with line numbers" option, which add the name of the file as 
     well as line numbers, this will be great for making review comments.


------------------------------

Version 1.1:

   * Release.

Version 1.0.7:

   * Horizontal diffs are calculated and displayed.  It rocks!
   * Toggle menus are now displayed/updated correctly.

Version 1.0.6:

   * Now supports any length of line.
   * Cleaner way to do search (no visible changes)

     visible regions correctly.

Version 1.0.4:

   * Man page is now generated and compiled inline by default.
   * I'm so sloppy, tabs other than 8 were still broken.
     Hopefully this is finally fixed.
   * Fixed a bug in the search feature.

   * Updated man page.
   * Redo diff is now a dialog that allows to change the command.

Version 1.0.2:

   * Fixed important tabs bug.
   * Added display of visible region in overview area.
   * Removed senseless "global unselected unselect" command.
   * Moved strstream's to stringstream's.
   * Added new color for changed regions which have text.

   * First public release, features match xdiff 1.0.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wishlist/ToDo list:
------------------------------


qt email list: question about CM


bug fixes:

   * Editing doesn't work anymore.

   * In dir diffs, remove toolbar buttons, selection menus, open file must be
     able to select a directory, etc. IOW finish checking that all that is left 
     works.

   * grab icons from other diffs

   * check out += problem in Makefile.in, with CPPFLAGS


new features:

   * cmdline option to select whether dirdiff should be recursive or not

   * Allow selection of text, as in an editor, just for cut-n-paste purpose.
   * dirdiff full path name cut-n-paste option
   * Add display options dialog with colors, remove color legend, remove tab 
     width dialog, one big dialog with all display options

   * Do nicer search dialog as well, designer-based
   * Remove useless dialogs in dialog.h

   * Provide some lame editing feature, people want it anyway.
   * low-hanging fruit: saving with ifdefs.
   * option: instead of saving merged file, save as a patch to be applied
     (save the two files in temps and run a diff on them).

   * Show symlinks, date and size of files in directory diffs
   * Add an icon somewhere to show if a directory diff or a simple file diff

   * Horizontal scrollbar should disappear when not necessary.

   * We need to link to GNU diff directly for the following reason: to avoid
     the temporary files, when capturing stdin, 
     We just gotta do it!  But keep supporting the fork() version.
     see dup2() for how to do this without modifying GNU diff code, and
     call main() myself.

   * drag sb in overview should scroll

   * Think about generic solution with scripts for CM management
     - what features do we want to implement?

		document idea about generic CM support!
		XxConfMgtInterface
		XxScriptConfMgtInterface
		script xxdiff.cvs
		script xxdiff.clearcase


perhaps features:

   * Perhaps change parser to read options as "category.blabla: value"
   * Add exclude option to diff options
   * Cleanup similar callbacks in XxApp.

   * Merged view cannot mouse-drag properly.  Implement a more viable solution
     that will allow to to the inverse drag as well, perhaps setting up a
     publicly-available indirection table in the XxDiffs object.

   * Improve color types documentation.

   * -w doesn't work on startup when cleardiff is the program we're using.
     Add resources for those arguments.

   * look at ClearCase's merge, see which ones they identify.

   * urgent bugs: ignore whitespace crashes, any two files (mcguffm)
     ==> can't reproduce.

   * urgent: make sure the errors dialog pops in front of the main window.
     ==> do at DL, where cleardiff returns some errors on belley's files.

   * merged view: add different colors for different selected sides

   * merged view: display both regions in merged view when unselected 
     (as an option)

   * conflicts... add possibility to save as ifdefs

   * make scripts for automatic release under linux: build tarballs and rpms
     automatically for both static and dynamically linked versions.

   * add sgml doc and install it with rpms

   * Oh, you just made me think of a new feature: invoking xxdiff with the auto
     merge feature, and if there are no conflicts it would save silently and not
     show up.... could be interesting.  I'll put that up on the wishlist.

   * allow region selection for the purpose of cut-n-paste (blouin)

(horizontal diffs)
   * horizontal diffs with hysteresis
   * horizontal diffs per word only (option)
   * horizontal diffs, case sensitive?  dunno (option)

(merged view)
   * Merged view: the motion commands should work from the merged view.
   * selection commands should work too
   * scrolling the merged view should scroll the other view as well.

(line numbers in own widget)
   * add + and | markers (don't call them annotations, this term is already used
     terminology for cut-n-paste annotations)

(Misc. UI)
   * overview area doesn't show line selections.
   * add invert selection functionality
   * "spawn editor" facility
   * You just HAVE to allow cut-n-paste annotations of IGNORE text.  Use
     extended selection!
   * what's this on a file widget should babble about the specific region
     which was clicked on.
   * xxdiff --version tries to open the display, we don't want that.
   * finish in context help
   * Allow dragging like a scrollbar in the overview area (like in mgdiff);
   * Automatically hide horizontal scrollbar if not needed;
   * it would be nice to be able to select both sides of a hunk for making 
     merge comments... but thru which UI do we do this?
   * Separate XxLine::DisplayType of resources... it does not make sense anymore
   * Implement motion bindings in the merged view too.

(resources)
   * do a resource parser that takes resources from the command line!
   * default opts for diff args
     (ignore white space, ignore case, etc.), do that in resources file text
     and should parse string also to detect them
   * generate sample.xxdiffrc file at runtime with an help option,
     default resources should be commented, added ones uncommented.

(make, compile, release process)
   * fix release_src script for IRIX specifics
   * when not compiling xrm or rcfile resources, don't compile the files at all
     (in makefile)
     ... problem with endif syntax... how can you add a GNU make conditional?
   * fix dist target under IRIX
   * link and distribute more easily with STLport under Irix.
   * Change the include files into the new ANSI ones e.g. #include <cstdio>, 
     will most likely be done when gcc-3.0 comes around;
   * Check GNU license wording, is that my choice in there ("at your option")?
   * License quirk?
> Dan Veditz: I find it one-sided. His suggestions
> make it possible for GPL'd projects to use
> mozilla, but do nothing to share reciprocally so

> aside from Qt."


(parsing)
   * exlpain how CRLF vs LF works in documentation
   * brightnessHistogramTestWinNTdbg.expect core dumps! check it out.
   * Detect unified diffs and throw on it, the user might specify such an 
     erroneous command;
   * allow diff using a patch file, even containing a patch for many files
     (easy: let patch patch the file on stdout, grab the output and perform 
      normal diff)
   * parse "merge" output and pre-select regions automatically.  this is
     especially important when using the "and next" commands.
   * look at all "diff" options and see if any other would be useful with the
     GUI (e.g. ifdef's saving).

(new features)
   * add case sensitivity to search feature
   * rename "regions" to "hunks" and use GNU diff terminology from texinfo
   * void XxApp::toggleOverview()?  set resources.
   * open left/right on an empty xxdiff should allow to open! 
     supporting one file only.  (on startup AND on an open diff) this can be
     done easily by specifying the "other" file as an empty file and running
     the current diff parser.
   * extended selection (on mouse release normal click except when straddling 
     lines) allow larger selection (smarter key down/up processing)
   * Drag-select for selecting multiple lines on button 2;
   * add option for confirmation when some regions are selected (for gijsbert)
   * add an option for splitting all CHANGE regions automatically
   * add an option to display context format diffs into its own widget, like 
     for the line numbers.
   * allow insertion of marker lines
   * Add save options for save selected only file dialog;
   * Keep the cursor line in region after swap->merge transition;
   * Find named color for default SGI scheme background color (greenish);
   * feature: show only hunks, collapse ignore regions...
   * feature: ignore diffs from "this" to "that" (-I option) should we have a
     different color for ignored diffs?  say e.g. case insensitivity done at the
     xxdiff level (for that the ``ignore'' algorithm must be done by xxdiff 
     itself)

(misc. bugs)
   * make sure non fixed-width fonts work
   * IgnoreBlankLines is a fundamental misfeature with xxdiff... how to deal
     with it?  figure it out later.

(one-pane view)
   * Support one-pane view;

(desktop integration)
   * add KDE/Gnome preferences (as optional);

(CM integration)
   * ClearCase/CVS should be integrated on the filename label and in a flexible
     way.

(documentation)
   * Integration DocBook documentation into runtime program/man page.  There
     should only be a single source of documentation (the SGML document), with
     a minimalist web page.

(Just ideas)
   * (Internal:) We could change all \n in the file for \0 so that returning a 
     line would not require the length, and also this way we wouldn't need
     print in a buffer in order to convert into a QString;
   * How about listening on a socket for an open command? This could be
     interesting if the GUI ever becomes too slow to start up, which is not
     the case now (at least not on my PII-350 nor my Octane);
   * Display of blank regions should be small, and scrolling should only occur 
     when there is text (complex to explain: text display will look like
     the overview area, with appropriate scrolling).  Prototype.
   * First click on a region selects, second deletes both, third unselects;
   * Popup menu should implement selection instead of motion commands, maybe 
   * depending on if clicked on an IGNORE region or not;
   * Reorganizing text in changed areas... drag-n-drop  la netscape toolbar?;
   * If arbitrary moving of regions is allowed, add a "reorder" command. Easy 
     to do, because we keep the original line nos even if we move stuff around;
   * editing facilities as in ediff (belley)?

KNOWN BUGS
------------------------------

   * Using diff option "-B" with xxdiff doesn't work for now.
