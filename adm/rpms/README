   Note to RPM Producers
===========================

It's really a shame that RH does not have some kind of central repository of
"official" rpm spec files, I really can't figure out which one is the one I
should be providing anymore.  I've been freed from the RPM mess years ago when I
moved to Gentoo (never looked back, it's been years), and I've given up on
actually supporting the 1000 RPM spec files out there.  Everyone seems to be
making their own spec files these days, so there is no "official" maintainer.

Plus the format is so ambiguous and full of implicit rules that you need to
become an RPM expert in order to bulid anything that many people can use.  For a
while there were contradicting versions of the documentation on the internet.  I
**really** can't be bothered with RPMs anymore.  I provide those files as
examples.

Now, if you submit a new RPM file, I will only put it aside the ones that are
here.  

If you REALLY want to make a meaningful contribution for everyone, consider
reconciling all of those into a single one that will work
everywhere-for-everyone.  Oh, and, BTW, good luck.  If you're an RPM expert,
please consider becoming some kind of official maintainer for the package.
